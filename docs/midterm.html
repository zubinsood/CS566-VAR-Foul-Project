        <h1>Mid-Term Report</h1>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Current Progress</h2>
            <p>
                Since submitting our proposal, we have focused on understanding the SoccerNet MV-Foul dataset and
                setting up the baseline multi-view model provided by the challenge organizers. The dataset includes
                short, multi-angle video clips labeled with both foul severity (No Card, Yellow, Red, etc.) and foul
                type (e.g., Pushing, Holding).
            </p>
            <p>We have successfully:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reviewed the dataset structure and verified the annotation format.</li>
                <li>Cleaned/verified the existing dataset, ensuring that the clips are accurate.</li>
                <li>Configured our development environment (Github, PyTorch, TorchVision, and SoccerNet utilities).</li>
                <li>Implemented and tested the baseline model, MVNetwork, which uses a 3D convolutional backbone
                    (R(2+1)D-18, S3D, or MViT-V2-S) combined with a multi-view aggregation layer (MVAggregate).</li>
                <li>Validated that the model can process dummy multi-view input clips and produce consistent output
                    shapes, confirming that the architecture and dependencies are functioning correctly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At this stage, we are preparing the dataset preprocessing pipeline and expect to begin baseline training
                during the first week of November.
            </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dataset Scale and Access:</strong> The SoccerNet MV-Foul dataset is large (tens of GBs/3000+
                    videos), and downloading and organizing the synchronized multi-view videos took longer than
                    expected.</li>
                <li><strong>Baseline Code Complexity:</strong> The official repository combines multiple tasks (foul
                    detection, spotting, and classification), which made it challenging to isolate/understand the actual
                    logic that relates to the foul detection.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>
                Our original plan included both multi-view model and pose-based features. Based on current progress, we
                are slightly adjusting priorities, focus mainly on improving the multi-view model until we get a decent
                evaluation score and then modify it later.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                We will evaluate our models using the official SoccerNet MV-Foul recognition metrics, which are
                integrated directly into the SoccerNet Python package and supported by the EvalAI evaluation server.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Foul Severity (4 classes)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No Offence</li>
                <li>Offence + No Card</li>
                <li>Offence + Yellow Card</li>
                <li>Offence + Red Card</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The evaluation metric for this task is balanced accuracy, which accounts for class imbalance.</p>

            <h3>2. Foul Type (8 classes)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tackling, Standing Tackling, High Leg, Holding, Pushing, Elbowing, Challenge, and Dive.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This task also uses balanced accuracy as the primary metric.</p>

            <p>
                We determined that using the official evaluation functions from the SoccerNet package will provide the
                most reliable and reproducible assessment of our model’s progress. During our baseline experiments, we
                will compute balanced accuracy for both tasks on the validation set, followed by test submission through
                EvalAI for leaderboard comparison.
